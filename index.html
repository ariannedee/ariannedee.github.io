      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Arianne and I'm applying for the Makerlabs residency.
      </p>
      <p class="highlight">
        You can check out my <strong><a href='cv.html'>maker experience</a></strong> or see <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arianne-dee-22290780">my CV on LinkedIn</a></strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have been a crafter since I was a child.
        At summer camp, you could find me 
        making bracelets and dream catchers with the councillors
        rather than playing with the other kids.
      </p>
      <p>
        In university I studied Civil Engineering,
        and too late into the degree did I realize that 
        they didn't actually get to build anything. 
        I would have to become a construction worker for that.
        Not even the mini architectural models? 
        No, you don't make those either.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast forward ten years, and I am working as a software developer.
        Even though I don't love computers,
        I enjoy the problem solving and the 
        the ease of creating something from nothing.
        But I can't shake the feeling that there's something missing
        when you can't touch what you've built.
        It's all just ones and zeroes.
      </p>
      <h2>Why do I want to do a residency at MakerLabs?</h2>
      <p>
        Because I am at a cross-roads in my career.
        I have always loved making things and have been struggling for years
        to find the time to do it.
        Now I want to see if I can make it more than just a hobby.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having spent the last four years as a software developer,
        working for other people, I am ready for a change.
        <ul>
          <li>
            I want to not sit at a desk all day
          </li>
          <li>
            I want to work directly with the people that I am building things for
          </li>
          <li>
            I want to work with more women
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Before hearing about this residency,
        I had already committed to leaving my job
        and trying to make a go of it on my own, with the assortment 
        of skills I have acquired so far in life.
        Programming, teaching, sewing, and woodworking were the primary candidates.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I know that I can code and teach for money,
        this residency would allow me to see if I can turn
        what I love as a hobby into a career 
        (or at least pay for itself + ramen).
      </p>
      <p>
        Last Thursday was my last day of work and I'll
        be dedicating the next 6 months to self-employment.
        I would love the Makerlabs community,
        to be a part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I would like to get out of the residency:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Dedicated time and space to pursue a maker career
          </li>
          <li>
            A collaborative environment with other women
          </li>
          <li>
            Mentorship, words of encouragement, and feedback
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        What I have to offer:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Good at brainstorming and coming up with creative solutions
          </li>
          <li>
            Positive attitude, and am not afraid to try things or make mistakes
          </li>
          <li>
            Can help others with coding (Python or HTML/CSS/Javascript), laser cutting, sewing, and woodworking
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        What I want to learn:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Welding & metalworking
          </li>
          <li>
            Using the CNC router
          </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            Time and project management skills
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
